        "A realtime assistance/collaboration tool for students and mentors. The goal was to improve the student experience when requesting assistance from a mentor, as well as improve mentor organization and efficiency working with the class. Our goal was to create an amazing experience both for students and mentors, the idea was to give them both quick feedback as to when they would be helped (for the student) and who should be receiving assistance right now (for the mentor). It became apparent that a real-time system would be an ideal solution, so we started our application design with that in mind. Our team settled on a real-time web application communicating with a central web server utilizing websockets to enable real-time communication between users."
